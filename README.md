Secure SCADA Protocol for the 21st century (SSP21) is a cryptographic wrapper for ICS environments. It is inspired by
the [Noise Protocol](http://noiseprotocol.org/).

# Specification

The specification is built using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). The included Makefile will generate PDF and HTML output.
